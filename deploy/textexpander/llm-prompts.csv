":abundance","Context: I believe that acting from a mindset of abundance instead of scarcity will lead to more success.
An abundance mindset is grateful, optimistic and believes there is more to go around. 
A scarcity mindset operates from lack, and believes in protecting what you have, and playing zero sum games.
Step 1: Create a 8 question quiz where you test which mindset I have right now.
Use multiple choice questions with 5 options for each answer, ensuring there isnâ€™t an obviously scarce or abundant option and the options randomly mixed.
Step 2: Ask for my input and wait for my input. Only proceed after I have given my input. Don't give the input yourself.
Step 3: Analyze my input: After I provide my answers, give me the results.
Step 4: make an assessment and suggest ways I can act from abundance more often, based on my answers. Propose concrete things to make an abundance mindset a habit for the areas where I have room to improve.

":goals","I want to set new goals. Start by asking me about my current goals, then dismiss them.
Tell me in a direct way that they are far too small, and press me with questions, delivered one by one,
that require me to create new, bigger goals.
Do not stop pressing me on these goals until they are significantly more aspirational than before.
